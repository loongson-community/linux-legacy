--------------------------------------
Simulator architecture:
______________________________________
  Godson CPU,which is compatible with R4000PC.
  Memory space, 0~0x7fffff is ram, 1fc00000~1fcfffff is flash, 1fd00000~1fdfffffis io.
  Device, serial port using 8250, register ports 0x3f8~0x3ff, using external interrupts pin 1.
  Using internal timer of CPU.

------------------------------------
Changlog:
____________________________________
 1.Directory arch/mips/godson/sim, new, all files are borrowed from P6032 and modified according to simulator architecture;
 2.Directory arch/mips, change config.in and Makefile, adding new items about simulator;
 3.Directory arch/mips/kernel, change head.S and setup.c. In file head.S, disable bss data initialization becausing of its time-consuming. In file setup.c, add a call to godson_sim_setup() and modify ramdisk initialization;
 4.Directory include/asm-mips/godson, new, some header files specific for simulator.
 5.Directory include/asm-mips, change serial.h and bootinfo.h, adding new items for simulator.
 6.Directory init, change main.c, disable some initialization steps.
 7.Directory drivers/block, change rd.c, reduce ramdisk copy to save time.
 8.Directory drivers/char, change serial.c because of incomplete simulation for verilog serial device.
