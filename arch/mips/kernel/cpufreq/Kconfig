	  This option ensures the R4K Timer works normally with the CPUFreq
	  driver. Currently, It is only designed for Loongson2F with specific
	  optimization.

	  If no external timer provided by your Loongson2F boards, this is
	  preferrable.

	  If unsure, say NO, but for Gdium netbook, Say Yes Please to ensure
	  the netbook is not too hot!

	  This option adds a CPUFreq driver for loongson processors which
	  support software configurable cpu frequency.

	  Loongson2F and it's successors support this feature.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.
